The RBSDE.py file contains the solver and classes needed to solve a Doubly Reflected Backward Stochastic differential equation with a backward-in-time algorithm. 
The file DynkinGame.py contains the implementation of the Dynkin game. In the file we also implemented an analysis on the exit times, which can be performed when solving the game multiple indipendent times.
